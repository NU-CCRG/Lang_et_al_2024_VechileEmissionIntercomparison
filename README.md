<h4>
<ul></ul><li><i>Emission analysis files</i> (available for each unique spatial resoltuion) include spatial figures, correlation coefficent scatter plots, box and whisker plots, and dataset minus the mean (calculate as the average of all four datasets).  </li>
<ul></ul><li><i>Equity analysis files</i> (available for each unique spatial resoltuion) include calculations for emission deciles and demographic composition within each decile and spatial figures for census tracts within the 10th decile (highest simulated emissions).</li>
